# 2021\_01 - "Sonar Sweep"

For part 1, we just need to count the number of times the datum increases from the previous one.

At first I thought we could use `>/` but that's going to expand to `1 > 2 > 3 > 4`, so first evaluates `3 > 4` to 0, then uselessly compare either 0 or 1 to the other data points.

So it seems we need to generate sliding windows and compare them: which is needed for the second part, anyhow.

This could be viewed as a kind of multiplication by a diagonally-bounded matrix that selects two consecutive items?

See <https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/Vocabulary/SpecialCombinations#diagonals>.

Actually it seems the J word for a part of a list is an [_infix_]:

> Any sequence of consecutive items along an axis of a noun.

[infix]: https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/Vocabulary/Glossary#Infix>

And [`x u\ y`][bslash2] (_infix_) applies the verb `u` to successive (overlapping) infixes of length `x` (when `x` is positive).

[bslash2]: https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/Vocabulary/bslash#dyadic

So `<\ 1 2 3 4` boxes up each overlapping infix.

How do we get it to apply in a dyadic context when they are length 2?

Oh, maybe with the _insert_ monad adverb, `u/ y`, which inserts `u` between the elements of `y`: the same thing that did not quite work, above...

       </\ 1 2 3 4 5
    1 1 0 0 0

That's strange? But the problem is, I forgot the `x` argument to the `\` verb, so it's really generating all the successive prefixes of the list:

       <\ 1 2 3 4 5
    ┌─┬───┬─────┬───────┬─────────┐
    │1│1 2│1 2 3│1 2 3 4│1 2 3 4 5│
    └─┴───┴─────┴───────┴─────────┘
    
Looking correctly at 2-windows:

       2 </\ 1 2 3 2 1
    1 1 0 0
