# 2021\_01 - "Sonar Sweep"

https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1

For part 1, we just need to count the number of times the datum increases from the previous one.

At first I thought we could use `>/` but that's going to expand to `1 > 2 > 3 > 4`, so first evaluates `3 > 4` to 0, then uselessly compare either 0 or 1 to the other data points.

So it seems we need to generate sliding windows and compare them: which is needed for the second part, anyhow.

This could be viewed as a kind of multiplication by a diagonally-bounded matrix that selects two consecutive items?
(There are some [special combinations for diagonals][] but none of them obviously help...)

Actually it seems the J word for a part of a list is an _[infix][]_:

> Any sequence of consecutive items along an axis of a noun.

[infix]: https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/Vocabulary/Glossary#Infix>

And [`x u\ y`][bslash2] (_infix_) applies the verb `u` to successive (overlapping) infixes of length `x` (when `x` is positive).

[bslash2]: https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/Vocabulary/bslash#dyadic

So `<\ 1 2 3 4` boxes up each overlapping infix.

How do we get it to apply in a dyadic context when they are length 2?

Oh, maybe with the _insert_ monad adverb, `u/ y`, which inserts `u` between the elements of `y`: the same thing that did not quite work, above...

       </\ 1 2 3 4 5
    1 1 0 0 0

That's strange? But the problem is, I forgot the `x` argument to the `\` verb, so it's really generating all the successive prefixes of the list:

       <\ 1 2 3 4 5
    ┌─┬───┬─────┬───────┬─────────┐
    │1│1 2│1 2 3│1 2 3 4│1 2 3 4 5│
    └─┴───┴─────┴───────┴─────────┘
    
Looking correctly at 2-windows:

       2 </\ 1 2 3 2 1
    1 1 0 0

To see how many there are where it increases we can simply sum the result, with `+/` (insert `+` between all elements){

       +/ 2 </\ 1 2 3 2 1
    2

We still have to work out how to parse the input, but first let's try the example from the problem statement:

       example =: 199 200 208 210 200 207 240 269 260 263

(It's hard to remember this is `=:` not a Pascal or Go-like `:=`, but it reads
as `equals double-dot`, and fits in with punctuation all having one or two
dots...)

       +/ 2 </\ example
    7

That's the correct answer!

The great thing is that this leads easily into part 2 of the question,
where we want to look for an increase in the sums of successive
3-element overlapping infixes.

The sums of the overlapping infixes are:

       3 +/\ example
    607 618 618 617 647 716 769 792'

Just to unpack it again, this is the `\` (infix) adverb, with `x=3` for
3-element overlapping infixes, and a `u` verb of `+/`, which in turn is
the `/` (insert) adverb applied to the `+` (plus) verb.

The pairs to compare, forming them as a matrix rather than boxes just
for a change, are:

       2 ,\ 3 +/\ example
    607 618
    618 618
    618 617
    617 647
    647 716
    716 769
    769 792

Here we apply the `,` (ravel) in monadic form to each 2-element overlapping
infixes. We could also have inserted it between the elements as `,`
(append), and got the same result: `,/\`.

In fact to just display the matrix it would also work to just use the
`[` (same) verb, that just returns its monadic argument, because we
don't really need any raveling or appending:

       2 [\ 3 +/\ example
    607 618
    618 618
    618 617
    617 647
    647 716
    716 769
    769 792
    
Anyhow... what we actually want is pairwise comparisons of the sums of
the 3-element windows, by inserting `<` between the 2-element infixes.

       2 </\ 3 +/\ example
    1 0 0 1 1 1 1
    
And the total where it increases is

       +/ 2 </\ 3 +/\ example
    5

That's the right answer for the example in the second part!

**TODO:** Read the input file and run it on my actual input.
