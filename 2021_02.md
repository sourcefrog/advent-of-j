# 2021\_02: Dive!

<https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2>

The input for this problem is a series of lines, each with a command and then a
parameter.

We can start by simply getting the file content into an array of characters:

       Input =: 1!:1 <'input/2021_02.txt'

Each line is a word followed by a number, so it would be natural to have a list of tuples, each of which is a string and a value. In J, matrices are always homogeneous: we can't directly have a matrix where the first column is a string and the second is a number.

But, there is a carve-out of "boxes", which can internally hold any noun.

To start with we can break it into an array of lines:

       (< ;. _2) Input

We want to break each of those lines into a pair of words. We could again use
the `;.` (_cut_) verb, but a simpler thing is possible: `;:` ([words][]) which
uses J's grammar for words.

       ;: 'forward 7'
    ┌───────┬─┐
    │forward│7│
    └───────┴─┘

(The line-drawing box indicates, intuitively enough, that it's an array of
boxes.)

We can extract words from every line of the input to get an array of boxes:

       (;: ;. _2) Input

Are the entries in the second column already numbers?

       > 1 { {. (;: ;. _2) Input
    1

They are not, but we can use `".` ([do][]) to evaluate them.

       10 + ". > 1 { {. (;: ;. _2) Input
    11

This is getting a bit unwield, so let's break out

       InputMatrix =: ;: ;. _2 Input

J likes homogeneous matrices, so maybe we should break this into two parallel vectors, one of commands (as strings) and one of arguments (as integers.) `{: y` ([tail][]) gives us the last item of y:

       {: InputMatrix
    ┌───────┬─┐
    │forward│5│
    └───────┴─┘

That gave the last row, but really we want the last column... It seems like this would be
possible with the `"` (rank) conjunction, but I don't quite see it.
